## Installation
1. Download the extension [here](https://github.com/jeffkeeling/tabrestorer/releases/download/v1.5/tabrestorer.safariextz)
2. Double-click the downloaded tabrestorer.safariextz file

## Usage
When you click the Tab Restorer button, you will see the 5 most recently closed tabs with the last closed tab at the top. Upon clicking one these links, it will open to the right of your currently open tabs.

### Optional Usage
If you open so many tabs that they overflow, it can be difficult to know if you really opened another new tab. In the settings for this extension, you can turn on a badge alert to flash when you open a new overflowed tab.
